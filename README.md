# node-starter

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/knpwrs/node-starter.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a generic starter project for node with the settings I typically use
for the following:

* babel
* eslint
* editorconfig
* direnv

Simply clone this repo, delete `.git`, _probably_ delete `package-lock.json`,
`npm i`, and go.
